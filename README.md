The extension comes packed with **advanced features**, including **queue management**, which enables you to submit URLs individually or in bulk, with the ability to clear the queue as needed. It offers **multiple URL submission options**, such as importing URLs from an XML sitemap via a URL, uploading an XML sitemap, or manually entering URLs. To further enhance usability, it provides **effortless management of service keys**, including the ability to regenerate keys for each store individually.

Automated processes are made possible with **cron support**, ensuring that queued URLs are submitted regularly without manual intervention. **Detailed log tracking** provides clear insights into the status of submitted URLs, with options to clear logs when necessary for better maintenance. The extension's **customizable store settings** allow you to enable or disable IndexNow services for each store and tailor URL submission and notification settings to fit your unique requirements.
