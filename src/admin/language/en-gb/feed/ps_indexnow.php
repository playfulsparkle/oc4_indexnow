<li><strong>Key Verification Issues:</strong> Ensure the key is accessible at the specified URL and follows the required format.</li>
<li><strong>Incorrect Key Usage:</strong> Use separate keys for each host unless specified otherwise.</li>

$_['text_faq']                            = '<details><summary>What happens after I submit a URL?</summary>Search engines will visit the URL to check for updates. The timing depends on their schedules and limits.</details>
<details><summary>What happens if I submit 10,000 URLs in one day?</summary>Search engines may visit some or all of them, depending on their limits for your site.</details>
<details><summary>Why isn’t my submitted URL showing up in search results?</summary>Submitting a URL lets search engines know about it, but they decide if and when to include it in search results.</details>
<details><summary>Should I submit old URLs?</summary>Only submit URLs that have been updated since you started using IndexNow.</details>
<details><summary>Do submitted URLs count towards my search engine limit?</summary>Yes, each visit by a search engine counts towards your limit, but submitted URLs are prioritized.</details>
<details><summary>Why aren’t all submitted URLs showing up?</summary>Search engines may skip some URLs if they don’t meet their guidelines.</details>
<details><summary>Why is one search engine showing my URL but not others?</summary>Each search engine uses its own rules to decide which URLs to include.</details>
<details><summary>Should I use IndexNow for a small website?</summary>Yes, it helps search engines find updates faster.</details>
<details><summary>Can I submit the same URL multiple times in a day?</summary>Avoid doing this often. Wait at least 10 minutes between updates.</details>
<details><summary>Can I submit URLs that no longer exist (404 errors)?</summary>Yes, this helps search engines know which links are no longer active.</details>
<details><summary>Can I submit new redirects?</summary>Yes, you can notify search engines about changes like new redirects.</details>
<details><summary>Can I submit all the URLs from my website?</summary>Only submit URLs that have recently changed. Use a sitemap for the full list of your site’s URLs.</details>
<details><summary>What should I do if I see an HTTP 429 error?</summary>This means you’ve sent too many requests. Slow down and try again later.</details>
<details><summary>When should I change my key?</summary>Change it if a search engine asks for a new one to verify your site.</details>
<details><summary>Can I use more than one key for my site?</summary>Yes, if you have different systems (like CMS) on your site, you can use different keys.</details>
<details><summary>Can I use one key for my entire domain?</summary>No, each part of your website (like different subdomains) needs its own key.</details>
<details><summary>Can I use the same key for multiple websites?</summary>Yes, you can use one key for several websites if you want.</details>
<details><summary>Do I still need IndexNow if I have a sitemap?</summary>Yes, IndexNow notifies search engines immediately, while sitemaps are checked less often.</details>
<details><summary>Where can I find more information?</summary>Check the help guides or documentation provided by each search engine.</details>';
