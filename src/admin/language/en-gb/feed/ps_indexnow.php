    <li>Enable the extension in your OpenCart admin panel.</li>
    <li>For each supported IndexNow service, enable the service individually.</li>
    <li>Configure the Service Key for each enabled service. If the key is not accessible from the server root, specify the Service Key URL where it can be accessed.</li>
    <li>Add the IndexNow endpoint to your cron job list to ensure the URL queue is processed periodically. Alternatively, you can run the endpoint manually to process the queue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The URL queue is automatically filled when you add, update, or delete products, categories, manufacturers, or information pages. This ensures that any changes made on your site will be promptly submitted to the search engines configured with IndexNow.</p>';
