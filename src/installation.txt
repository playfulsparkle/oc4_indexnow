Playful Sparkle - IndexNow

The Playful Sparkle - IndexNow extension for OpenCart 4.x+ provides a powerful
way to enhance your store’s visibility by notifying supported search engines
whenever URLs on your store are added, updated, or deleted. With this extension,
your store can quickly and automatically notify search engines like Bing and
Yandex whenever changes are made, ensuring that these changes are indexed much
faster than traditional crawling.

Features

- Queue Management: Add URLs to a queue and submit them individually or all at
  once, with the ability to clear the queue.
- Multiple URL Submission Options: Submit URLs via imported sitemaps, XML file
  uploads, or manually entered URLs.
- Service Key Management: Regenerate your service key for each store
  individually, as needed.
- Cron Support: Choose between using the extension-provided cron URL or
  OpenCart's cron page URL to send queued URLs to the IndexNow services.
- Detailed Log Tracking: Monitor the status of submitted URLs in the logs and
  clear the logs when necessary.
- Customizable Store Settings: Enable or disable IndexNow services for each
  store separately and configure URL submission and notification settings
  per store.
- Easy Integration: Simple installation and configuration, with an automatically
  generated service key for each store.
- Compatibility: Integrates smoothly with OpenCart 4.x+, supporting a range of
  online store setups.
- Multilingual Support: Ready for international use with languages including
  Čeština (cs-cz), Deutsch (de-de), English (GB) (en-gb), English (US) (en-us),
  Español (es-es), Français (fr-fr), Magyar (hu-hu), Italiano (it-it),
  Русский (ru-ru), and Slovenčina (sk-sk).
