Playful Sparkle - IndexNow

The Playful Sparkle - IndexNow extension for OpenCart 3.x+ revolutionizes how
your store communicates with search engines by leveraging the powerful IndexNow
protocol. This innovative extension allows your store to quickly and
automatically notify supported search engines like Bing and Yandex whenever
content such as products, categories, or articles is added, updated, or deleted.
By ensuring these changes are indexed faster than traditional crawling methods,
the extension significantly improves your store's visibility and
search performance.

The extension comes packed with advanced features, including queue management,
which enables you to submit URLs individually or in bulk, with the ability to
clear the queue as needed. It offers multiple URL submission options, such as
importing URLs from an XML sitemap via a URL, uploading an XML sitemap, or
manually entering URLs. To further enhance usability, it provides effortless
management of service keys, including the ability to regenerate keys for
each store individually.

Automated processes are made possible with cron support, ensuring that queued
URLs are submitted regularly without manual intervention. Detailed log tracking
provides clear insights into the status of submitted URLs, with options to
clear logs when necessary for better maintenance. The extension's customizable
store settings allow you to enable or disable IndexNow services for each store
and tailor URL submission and notification settings to fit your
unique requirements.

With its easy integration, seamless installation, and setup process,
the extension is designed to deliver maximum efficiency. By harnessing the
powerof IndexNow, this extension ensures your store’s content changes are
indexed faster and more effectively than ever before.
