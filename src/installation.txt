Playful Sparkle - IndexNow

The Playful Sparkle - IndexNow extension for OpenCart 4.x+ revolutionizes how
your store communicates with search engines. This extension allows your store to
quickly and automatically notify supported search engines like Bing and Yandex
whenever store content is added, updated, or deleted. By ensuring these changes
are indexed faster than traditional crawling methods, the extension helps
improve your store’s visibility and search performance.

Take advantage of powerful features like queue management, where URLs can be
submitted individually or all at once, with the ability to clear the queue
as needed. Choose from multiple URL submission options, including importing
URLs from XML sitemap from URL, uploading XML sitemap, or manually
entering URLs. Manage service keys effortlessly with the ability to regenerate
keys for each store individually.

Cron support allows for automated submissions of queued URLs, while detailed log
tracking provides insight into the status of submitted URLs, with options to
clear logs when necessary. Customizable store settings let you enable or disable
IndexNow services for each store and configure URL submission and notification
settings tailored to your needs. The extension’s easy integration ensures a
seamless installation and setup process.
